This code is designed to detect Parkinson's disease using a machine learning approach. It involves loading a dataset, preprocessing the data, training an XGBoost classification model, evaluating the model's accuracy, and visualizing the results. The data is first scaled and split into training and testing sets. After training the model, predictions are made on the test set, and the accuracy is calculated. Finally, a bar chart is generated to visualize the proportion of predicted positive and negative diagnoses, providing a clear representation of the model's performance.
